0,"OLF AG sa- SUTEANS AND OTHER WEST SEMITES DURING THE LATTER HALF OF THE SECOND MILLENNIUM B.C. M. Heltzer’s recent monograph! displays an impressive command of the data and presents clearly the history of the Suteans (sg. Suti*). The conclusion (p. 98) that the Suteans were assimilated with the Arameans is most likely*. This article presents more evidence for this process, evidence which is entirely indirect. ‘Suti seems to have become more and more a general term for West Semitic nomads from the middle of the second millennium B.C. on- wards. This term is recorded several times in MA sources, notably economic documents, whereas the term Aflami is never mentioned in such MA documents. Ablami, which is recorded in Babylonian documents from the late OB period onwards (see below), is attested in Assyria only in royal inscriptions and not earlier than the reign of Arik-den-ili (1319-1308 B.C.). In faci, the term appears for the first time only in the inscriptions of his son, Adad-nirari I (1307- 1275 B.C.), who mentioned that his father had fought against the Ablami. The appearance of the West Semitic term Aflami, which became common in Middle Babylonian, ia Assyrian royal inscriptions is understandable in view of the fact that the language and style of these inscriptions were strongly influenced by Babylonian. On the other hand, no documents from Kassite Babylonia mention the term 1 The Suteans (with a contribution by SH. ARBRy!).

1,"60 R. ZADOK Suri. Regarding Middle Babylonian, this term (fem. [Su]-te-1) appears only in a letter which had been written outside Babylonia (in Tilmun) and was sent to Nippur* (mentions also Aj-la-mu-i). Admittedly, ‘Su-ti-i is mentioned in Chronicle’P*, which is composed in SB, but a Post-Kassite date of its final edition cannot be ruled out®. MA Suti can be rendered as “‘West Semitic nomad”. The Suteans of Ja-i-ri are mentioned after the Ahlamé as early as the reign of Adad-nirari I. Their name is West Semitic, but its form is different from Bibl. Ya°ir (LXX Iaeip’). The term Suti (alone) is recorded much more frequently than Yauri in MA sources. All the MA documents mentioned below were found in Assur unless otherwise   Yaurean Suteans (Su-teo-e J-ia-ii-ra-ie®) was inspected and collected by Silli-Diqla the customs official (or tax collector, “makisu) at KuliSbi- na& in the eponymy of Usat-Marduk (reign of Shalmaneser I, 1274- 1245 B.C.). The provenience of the document may be Tall-‘Amida (Syr. ‘Amfdin, classical Amoudis) in the Habur Triangle. Therefore, the possibility that Tall-“Amiida = Kuli8hina’ cannot be eliminated?. If [x](-Ja-ti-ra'°, which is mentioned in an undated document dealing with fields near Alu 3a a-pa-ti, can be restored*! as [J]Ja--ra then this would be another example of a tribal name used as a personal name. Alu 8a apati is also mentioned in two other MA documents!?. Apart from the occurrences of the Sutean tribes (Sué) and their territories (bit-Suté, nage-Suté**, Suté of the land of Qa-at-[na??] and Suté of 4 A. GOETZE apud P.B.

[Heb.]) suggested to identify the Yaureans with the Biblical Yairites. Both forms derive from “-W/Y-R (Hebrew, Arabic; derivatives in Akkadian and Ugaritic) ‘be or become light’. This root is poorly documented in Aramaic (Syriac has the causative ‘illuminate’). There is no positive evidence for the physical identity of the Yaureans and Yairites who appear in different, and in fact remote, areas. A forerunner of the name Ya’ir can be Am. Ja-i-ru-wn (D. CHARPIN, RA 72, 1978, p. 141: 42a, 26; OB). 8 J.-M. AyNarD and J.-M. Duranp, Assur 3/1, 1980, p. 44: 11, 3f. ° See Ku.

All the patronyms of ‘the individuals named ‘Suri’, whose genealogy is specified, are Akkadian, an indication that these people were not actually nomads, but probably originated from a nomadic group.

and (3) contain forms which are attested as theophorous elements
only in the first millennium B.C. A tribute’ list mentions, inter alia,
Ru-ga-ha-ia which may refer to the West Semitic tribe of Rugaju; the
list could be dated to Tiglath-Pileser I’s reign, but a slightly earlier
date, viz. that of Tukulti-Ninurta-A’8ur, cannot be ruled out®°.

A business trip to the land of the Chaldeans (harranu Sa"" Kal-da-
ia-é”*) ig mentioned one line after Sad(KUR)-E-be-eh®! which is
thought to have been the ancient name of Jabal Hamrin (+ Jabal
Makhill?) ©, This plural form possibly designated a tribal area (cf. the
“land of the Suteans” above). The document is from the reign of
Tiglath-Pileser I (c. 1100 B.C.),-ize-c-225-years before the Chaldeans
appear as inhabitants of southern Babylonia in
sources. The location
of their land in this earliest occurrence is not described, and its listing
after Ebeh surely does not guarantee that it was located nearby. However,
it stands to reason that it is to be sought somewhere in the periphery
of Babylonia, perhaps east of the Tigris and not too far from the
southern border of Assyria proper.

An appellative which appears only in Assyrian but not in Babylonian
is adru, i.e. ‘threshing floor’. It is related to Aram. “iddar ‘id.’, but
since adru is recorded as early as OA, it cannot be regarded an
Aramaic loanword in Akkadian. The spelling id-ri appears in three MA
documents (KAJ 153-155). According to Ebeling®?, KAJ 153 and 155
are ‘from the reign of Eriba-Adad I whereas KAJ 154 is from A8Sur-
ubalit I’s reign. In Fine’s opinion, all the three documents could be
dated to A&Sur-uballit I’s reign ®5. CAD® remark : “The variant idru ...
may reflect Aramaic influence”. Yet, the difference here is minimal
so that it is not necessarily caused by a non-Assyrian dialect, the more
so in view of the fairly early date. Is the MA toponym Li-di-nu®?
West Semitic? (precative of D-W/Y-N ‘judge’ with an Assyrian vowel

typically Aramaic. Another MA toponym is Gubb-ekalli, i.e. “The
cistern of the palace”. The appellative gubbu is recorded only in

and N/LB and is regarded as a West Semitic loanword”°. It is well-
attested in Aramaic toponymy. The toponym is spelled Gu-be-kal-li
(with sandhi), Gu-(ub-)bé-E.GAL"" and Gu-ub-bé-e-kal-li7! thus ex-
cluding other readings of its initial component. It is mentioned in
one document”? from the reign of Eriba-Adad I (1392-1366 B.C.) and
in eight documents’? from the reign of ASSur-uballit I (1365-1330
B.C.”4), There is some reason to suspect that gubbu already existed in
Amorite : cf. the toponyms OB Gu-ub-ba-tumt 73 and MB Gub-ba-tu,''76,
Gubb-ekalli, which was situated across the Siséar Canal (” Si-i[5-sar),
'7§i-Sar77), might have been located on the fringe of the desert if one
accepts H.J. Nissen’s identification’® of Sixsar with
Tartar =
modern Wadi-Tartar (< WSem. *Tartar?®). Other settlements which
were located on the Siisar Canal®° are :

(1) Bar-rapate which contains the only assured occurrence of biiru
‘cistern’ (also Aram.) in MA (otherwise biirtu; only MB letters, SB and

have also biiru*), (2) Sadada on the same canal is non-Akkadian,
but (3) Alu 8a Il:-itti-ilu is.

OB period. In fact, they appear in-an asiru-text®? bearing the year
formula MU Ri-im-An-nu-um LUGAL.E. The text mentions the Abla-

The gentilic suffix -dj(um)/ajj(um) is attached to toponyms in OB sources from Upper Mesopotamia (Mari and Tall §7), but not in sources from Syria-Palestine (except for the northern city of Ugarit where this suffix occurs along with -ij(jum) in the 14th and 13th centuries B.C.®*). It is extant in Babylonia before c. 1500 B.C. only as a suffix — apparently hypo- coristic — attached mostly to short stems (qVtl/qVit®°). In view of its limited geographical distribution in Amorite, there is some reason to regard this suffix as the forerunner of the Aramaic nisbe. Ablamites are mentioned in MB sources from Babylonia, Tilmun, Emar Boghazkéy°°, as wellas royal inscriptions. The Aramean Ablamites are first mentioned in 1112 B.C., but the soldiers of the Hiranu tribe, which is defined as Aramean in sources, were stationed in Upper Mesopotamia as early as the 14th century B.C. The settlement Pi-it (Middle Elamite for Bit-) Ra-ap-i-kul-...}(?) (poss. in eastern Babylonia‘), which appears in an Elamite list of Babylonian places conquered by Silbak-InSu8inak (c. 1155-1136 B.C.), might have been named after the Aramean tribe of Rapiqu®?. Rapiqu was originally a town and region on the border of Babylonia proper and Sithu. The Ablamites mentioned in MB sources are mostly anonymous; the named ones bore Akkadian and Kassite names °?. Aflami is not identical with Amurra in MB. The latter term possibly designated a person originating 84 See F.R. Kraus, 4fO 16, 1952/3, p. 322, n. 13; Th. JACOBSEN, OIP 43, p. 199; D.O.

The only West Semitic personal names from Kassite Babylonia seem to be: (1) Ab-di9® (1324 B.C.; cf. above), (2) Ha-li-li°® (undated), (3) Ha-na- nu-t(2)°7 (1284 B.C.), (4) Na-am-pa-gu (son of Ea-iddin-""x’®*) and (5) Ab-du-!Nergal(U.GUR). Yet, (2) and (3) could alternatively be interpreted as non-Semitic hypocoristica®®. (4), who probably was a scribe, appears on a seal. His name may be related to thé toponym Nampigi in northern Syria which can be etymologized as Aramaic. N-B/P-G denotes “gush out, rise; raise out, emerge, spring up, sprout”. It may be extant also in Amorite Na-bi-gu-um ‘°°. The occurrence of a scribe bearing a non-Akkadian (and non-Sumerian) name is exceptional in Babylonia, but since his seal is of unknown provenience and bears neither a date nor an iconographic presentation, it cannot be excluded that it is peripheral and dates slightly later than the Kassite period. The same applies to (5)!°1. (1-3) occur in documents which were found at Nippur. The names from Kassite Babylonia (all from Nippur), which begin with ya-, such as Ja-gi-ia and Ja/Iu-um-ri'°, are too short and there- fore cannot be regarded reliable evidence for the presence of West Semites there, the more so since they do not yield convincing West Semitic etymologies. The only exceptions seem to be (6) Ja-b/pu-ti-a*°* (1307/6 B.C.) which may be related to Canaanite (EA) ia-pu ‘beauti- ful’+°* (with -a). Alternatively, it could be an interrogative sentence °4 In M.H. Morrison and D.1. OWEN (eds.), Studies on the Civilization and Culture of Nuzi and the Hurrians in Honor of E.R.

A MB deed!°” from Susa dated to Tepti-ahar’s reign (early 14th
century B.C.) mentions J/-la-di-nu (son of Kidin) whose name (*""I/-ladin)
is West Semitic. This name is of a type which is rarely attested in
Amorite, but is well-documented in Ancient Aramaic?©®,

The only West Semitic toponyms known from the Arrapba region

perhaps Dimat(AN.ZA.GAR)-Mu-ul-a-nif-xx(2)!""°, The last. to-

variant of the non-Semitic toponym Halman (> Holwan) referring
to a town not far from Arrapha. The Hurrian gentilic suffix (represented
by -wa) is attached to Ha-lu-(ul-)li of ““Ya-heul-li-wa!*? or Ha-lwli-
wa"" from Arrapha/Nuzi. CAD?""* interpret haluli as ‘fruit’(?2), but
a derivation from H-L-L ‘be hollow’ or sim. (WSem.) is more suitable
for a toponym (cf.
Ha-lu-le-e1""%),

The location of the MB waterway ""Na-ah-lu hi-in-ta-at™*7, whose
name could be West Semitic (to *hinfat ‘wheat’!), is not known
(cither in Babylonia, perhaps in the Diyala region as it was found
not far from Baghdad, or in Upper Mesopotamia).

The relevant documentation from Upper Mesopotamia (all MA) is
rather disappointing for the time being. That from Tall ar-Rimah does
not contain any assured West Semitic anthroponyms (except, perhaps,

toponyms. The possibility that the few West Semitic toponyms, which
are mentioned in the MA texts from Tall ar-Rimah, are merely
survivals from the OB period when the site was inhabited mostly by
Amorites cannot be excluded. The best example is MA Qa-ta-ra < OB
Qé-ta/ta-ra(-a)**° which could refer to Tall ar-Rimah itself. Other
toponyms are not recorded in OB: Ra-ag/q-mi, cf. Bibl. Regem (to
R-G-M which means in Ugaritic ‘say, tell’), Arab. rujm ‘heap of
stones’!?° on the one hand and Bibl. and Post-Bibl. Regem (GN) on
the other. Ha-ma-ra-sa'?! might have originated from Am. A-hi-ma-
ra-as!?? with an aphaeresis!??. Another such toponym is perhaps
[Te( ??)]-ma-ni-te'?*, The gentilic Ha-na-ia, i.e. ‘Wanean’, appears in
three documents from Tall ar-Rimah :

Mil-ka-ni son of ""Ri-i8'-ba-am-ru of ““Ha-ma-ra-sa. ‘Ha""-na( ?)-{ia]
appears in TR 2026, 5°!76 dated to the eponym Sunu-qardu (sometime
between 1244 and 1208 B.C.1?7). However, it cannot be ruled out
that Mil-ka-niis an Akkadian name’**. Ha-na-ifa] father of A-be-KAM
(poss. Abi-ili!?°) of ““Ha-ma-ra-sa is recorded in TR 2903, 513°
whose date has been lost. The date has not been preserved in TR 2084A,
12°13 which mentions Ha-na-ia-e after Su-tes-e. For the land of the
Suteans cf. above.

None of the very few West Semitic anthroponyms and toponyms
mentioned above (except, perhaps, for I/-la-di-nu) is typically Aramaic.
On the contrary, there are some indications that they are rather of the
Amorite type.

(between Magrisi and Latibi; eponymy of Ina-A&sur- Suma-asbat) which is a nagtal formation, conceivably a participle of P-R-S ‘break through; open’ (also said of water) which is productive in toponymy; cf.

MARCHANDS HITTITES A UGARIT Dans ma communication ', je me propose d’analyser le traité commer- cial entre Ugarit et ""Empire Hittite, le traité des fils d’Ura avec les fils d’Ugarit?. L’importance de ce texte fut, certes, reconnue tout de suite et plusieurs études lui furent consacrées, mais les chercheurs — c’est symptomatique — n’étaient intéressés que par la question de savoir si ce texte jette ou non plus de lumiére sur les patriarches, plus spécialement sur Abraham. Ce n’est donc pas di au hasard si les problémes essentiels posés par le traité n’ont pas encore été étudiés. Pourtant, les dispositions de celui-ci ne sont pas seulement extrémement intéressantes, mais, comme j’essayerai de le montrer, elles nous fournissent des informations substantielles pour apprécier le caractére de l’économie dans 1’anti- quité proche-orientale. La plus importante mesure — le bannisse- ment périodique des marchands hittites — est sans paralléle, non seulement dans l’histoire économique du Proche-Orient, mais, 4 ma connaissance, dans toute histoire économique. Ce nonobstant ou, peut-étre, pour cette raison méme, on lui avait attribué relativement peu d’attention. On s’était contenté de constater l’impartialité dont le roi hittite avait fait preuve, son jugement étant dirigé contre ses propres marchands, ce qui témoigne clairement de bonnes relations existant entre les deux royaumes*. Tout cela correspond évidemment aux faits, sans toutefois en consti- tuer la substance.
